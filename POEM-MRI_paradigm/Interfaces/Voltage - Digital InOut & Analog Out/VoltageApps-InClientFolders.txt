Both 32-bit and a 64-bit versions of ViewPoint Voltage are distributed.  
See the relevant folder and executable, either:

  ~\ViewPoint\Interfaces\VPx32-Client\Voltage_32.exe

  ~\ViewPoint\Interfaces\VPx64-Client\Voltage_64.exe

The 64-bit version may be copied to the main ViewPoint folder and used
directly from there, however the 32-bit verion must be run with the 32-bit
VPX_InterApp_32.dll that communicates with ViewPoint via ViewPointClient_32.exe
