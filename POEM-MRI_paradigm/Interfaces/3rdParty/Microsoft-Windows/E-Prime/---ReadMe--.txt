E-Prime 3.0 is a 32- bit application, while ViewPoint is a 64-bit application.

To interface with E-Prime with ViewPoint, move your E-Prime 3.0 experiments to the ./ViewPoint/Interfaces/VPx32-Client/ folder. Launch ViewPointClient_32.exe and connect to the ViewPoint EyeTracker. The User Script file must specify the VPX_InterApp_32.dll.
