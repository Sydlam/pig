If you get an error message regarding a missing "MSVCP120.dll" then you should install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013.

If you are using a 64-bit version of Windows, 
you should install "vcredist_x64.exe".
You can also optionally install the "vcredist_x86.exe".

If you are using a 32-bit version of Windows, 
you should install only the "vcredist_x86.exe".
