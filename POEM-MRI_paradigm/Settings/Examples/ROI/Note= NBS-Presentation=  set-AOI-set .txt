NBS PRESENTATION

Some interfaces, for example Presentation, 
send integers to specify region of interest groups,
or in Presentation vernacular "set AOI set".
 
ViewPoint provides an interface by converting this 
into a CLI command: "settingsFile_load 'ROI/N.txt' ", 
where N is the integer specified, 
and the folder ROI is the folder: ViewPoint/Settings/ROI/

WARNING:  ROI #0 is deprecated and should not be used.
